title: Simulating Bird-oid Objects
---

As a part of HPC, I has to do a big semester long project. Specifically, I would need to do some simulation, demonstrate issues with scalability and implement some parallelisation to achieve performance at large working sets. This project ended up being quite fun, with a nice combination of real time rendering, multithreaded algorithm optimisation and data analysis.

It also didn't help I got to run stuff on UQ's fancy HPC clusters, quite fun.

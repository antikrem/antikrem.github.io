title: Simulating Bird-oid Objects
---

As a part of HPC, I has to do a big semester long project. Specifically, I would need to do some simulation, demonstrate issues with scalability and implement some parallelisation to achieve performance at large working sets. This project ended up being quite fun, with a nice combination of real time rendering, multithreaded algorithm optimisation and data analysis.

It also helped that I got to run stuff on UQ's fancy HPC clusters with some cool visual output, quite fun. 

As infered from the above gif, my project was on [boids](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/), which is a multiagent simulation that replicates the flocking of birds, fishes and other flocking creatures. This project came our nicer than I expected, with some novel additions on my end, so here are some highlights from my report:

## Deterministic Scattering

## Optimised Multithreaded Algorithm
My first implementation of multithreading in psuedo-code looked something like this:

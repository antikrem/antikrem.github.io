title: Simulating Bird-oid Objects
---

As a part of HPC, I has to do a big semester long project. Specifically, I would need to do some simulation, demonstrate issues with scalability and implement some parallelisation to achieve performance at large working sets. This project ended up being quite fun, with a nice combination of real time rendering, multithreaded algorithm optimisation and data analysis.

It also helped that I got to run stuff on UQ's fancy [HPC clusters](https://research.smp.uq.edu.au/computing/getafix.html) with some cool visual output, quite fun. 

As infered from the above gif, my project was on [boids](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/), which is a multiagent simulation that replicates the flocking of birds, fishes and other flocking creatures. This project came our nicer than I expected, with some novel additions on my end, so here are some highlights from my report:

## Deterministic Scattering

## Optimised Multithreaded Algorithm
My first implementation of multithreading in psuedo-code looked something like this:
```
for i = 0 to frame count

	make thread group
	
	for each relevant boid (managed by #pragma omp for)
		do boid step
	
	for each relevant boid (managed by #pragma omp for)
		do update
	
	close thread group
	
end for
```

Observe how the boidal update is split into `do boid step` and `do update`. The first updates individual boid's velocities based on surrounding near neighbours, while the second uses each boids velocity to update its position. Splitting this into 2 steps allows a single lock between these steps, rather than a lock on each boid's position access, neat.

For each frame of the simulation, I would create a thread group of `N` size, and OpenMP will manage allocating boids to each thread. After executing the boid rules and updating position, the thread group would be destroyed and a new one would be created for the next thread. A rather large improvement I made was creating a thread group for all the frames, and manually allocating which boids are allocated to each thread:

```
make thread group
calculate which boids are allocated to update
for i = 0 to frame count
	
	wait for other threads
	
	for each allocated boid
		do boid step
	
	wait for other threads	
	
	for each allocated boid
		do update
	
end for
close thread group
```

And testing was able to show improvement:

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

The important takeaway is to use thread pools over spawning a thread for each workload. Useful for game engines, with my latest using a unified thread pool over the old method of spawning new threads.

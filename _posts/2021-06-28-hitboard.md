title: Hitboard - Emulating Arcade Controllers on Keyboard. 
---
If you want to improve your execution without buying a crazy expensive mix box, this might be for you. Hitboard emulates arcade controllers on you're keyboard through keyboard hooks and a virtual direct-x controller. Create a profile to emulate an existing controller, and pull off some sick combos!

## Usages
Primarily, the benefit of Hitboard is customising SOCD resolution. Different controllers have different ways of handling this to varying degrees of customisation. With Hitboard, both cardinal axis can have separate and fully customisable resolutions. 

## Applications
A few uses that help me out are as follows:

### Fast dash
### Wave Dash
### Giants swing from Wave Dash
### EWGF
### iWR Shining Wizard
